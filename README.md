# Genetic Testing for Disorder Detection

As per reports, as a consequence of the unsustainable increase in population and a lack of access to adequate health care, food, and shelter, the number of genetic disorder ailments have increased. Hereditary illnesses are becoming more common due to a lack of understanding about the need for genetic testing. Often kids die as a result of these illnesses, thus genetic testing during pregnancy is critical.

Most columns carry the characteristic of their own name. Let me explain some columns.

- **Genes in mother's side**: Represent a gene defect in a patient's mother
- **Inherited from father**: Represent a gene defect in a patient's father
- **Paternal gene**: Represent a gene defect in a patient's paternal side of the family
- **Respiratory Rate(breaths/min)**: Represents a patient's respiratory breating rate
- **Heart Rate (rates/min)**: Represents a patient's heart rate
- **Parental Consent**: Represents whether a patient's parents approved the treatment plan
- **Follow-up**: Represents a patient's level of risk (how intense their condition is)
- **Folic acid details (peri-conceptional)**: Represents the periconceptional folic acid supplementation details of a patient
- **H/O serious maternal illness**: Represents an unexpected outcome of labor and delivery that resulted in significant short or long term consequences to a patient's mother
- **H/O radiation exposure (x-ray)**: Represents whether a patient has any radiation exposure history
- **H/O substance abuse**: Represents whether a parent has a history of drug addiction
- **Assisted conception**: Represents the type of treatment used for infertility
- **Birth defects**: Represents whether a patient has birth defects
- **TARGET** : 
  - Genetic Disorder
  - Disorder Subclass

## OUTCOME 

- The analysis of this model centers around assessing the relevance of genetic testing at birth, aiming to address potential health issues before they escalate in later life stages, potentially leading to severe consequences. 
- The data indicates noteworthy observations related to specific columns like 'Birth Defects' and 'History of Anomalies in Previous Pregnancies.' These factors seem to provide significant insights into potential health conditions.
- Additionally, the model highlights the necessity for more comprehensive details regarding the parents in understanding a child's genetic predispositions. The genetic makeup of a child is notably influenced by the genetic information inherited from their parents. 
- Therefore, exploring and considering the genetic attributes of the parents emerges as a crucial aspect to better comprehend the potential health outcomes and predispositions of the child. This emphasizes the importance of investigating parental genetic information to gain a comprehensive understanding of the child's genetic composition and potential health risks.
